      Waffles are a breakfast food that are made by cooking batter between two
      plates of a waffle iron. The result is a fluffy and crispy pastry with
      distinctive grid-like patterns on its surface. Waffles can be enjoyed
      sweet or savory, and can be served with a variety of toppings, such as
      whipped cream, syrup, fruit, or fried chicken
