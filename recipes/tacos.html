  Tacos are a popular Mexican dish that typically consist of a tortilla filled
  with various ingredients, such as seasoned meat, beans, cheese, lettuce,
  tomatoes, and salsa. Tacos can be made with a variety of fillings, ranging
  from classic beef or chicken to vegetarian or vegan options. They are usually
  served with a side of rice, beans, and/or guacamole, and can be customized to
  suit different tastes and spice levels. Tacos can be eaten as a snack, a meal,
  or even for breakfast.
