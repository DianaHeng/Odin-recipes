      Tacos are a popular Mexican dish that typically consist of a tortilla
      filled with various ingredients, such as seasoned meat, beans, cheese,
      lettuce, tomatoes, and salsa. Tacos can be made with a variety of
      fillings, ranging from classic beef or chicken to vegetarian or vegan
      options. They are usually served with a side of rice, beans, and/or
      guacamole, and can be customized to suit different tastes and spice
      levels. Tacos can be eaten as a snack, a meal, or even for breakfast.
